Mqtt
=====
This is an mqtt client written in DART. 
It can be used in the browser (over websocket) or the VM (over socker or websocket). 
 
See http://mqtt.org/ for details on mqtt protocol 


Usage
-------

Create a connection over websocket:
    var mqttCnx = new MqttConnectionIOWebSocket.setOptions("ws://127.0.0.1/8080");
    
Create a connection over socket:
    var mqttCnx = new MqttConnectionIOSocket.setOptions(host:127.0.0.1, port: 8083);
    
Create mqtt client:
	MqttClient c = new MqttClient(mqttCnx, clientID: "MyClientID", qos: QOS_1);


Set a will (must be done before connecting to the broker):
	c.setWill("MyWillTopic", "MyWillPayload", QOS_1, 0);

Connect to broker:
	c.connect(onConnectionLost)
    	.then( (c)=> onConnected(c) ) 
    	.catchError((e) => print("Error: $e"), test: (e) => e is SocketException)  
    	.catchError((mqttErr) => print("Error: $mqttErr")
    	);      
    	
Publish a message:
  c.publish("MyTopic", "MyMessage", 1, QOS_1, 0)
      .then( (m) => print("Message ${m.messageID} published");
      );

Subscribe to a topic:
	c.subscribe("MyTopic", QOS_1, onMessage)
  		.then( (s) => print("Subscription done - ID: ${s.messageID} - Qos: ${s.grantedQoS}") );

Unsubscribe:
	c.unsubscribe("MyTopic", s.messageID)
		.then( (u) => print("Unsubscribed from subscription ${u.messageID}") );
		
Disconnect:
	c.disconnect();    
    
    
    
VM Example
-----------

See mqtt_sub for a sample mqtt publish and mqtt_pub for a sample subscribe.
Available options can be displayed through:
	> dart mqtt_sub.dart -?
	> dart mqtt_pub.dart -?

Web Example
-----------
	
See Mqtt_web for a sample web page connecting, subscribing and publishing mqtt messages

    
Testing
----------
Testing was done using the mosquitto broker (http://mosquitto.org/).
A mosquitto test server is available at http://test.mosquitto.org/.

Websocket testing was done throught mqtt_ws_bridge.dart.
